    "In this example, we come to a different type of model system, the three-species May-Leonhard Model. It is also sometimes called the cyclic Lotka-Volterra model for the simple reason that its three species A, B and C are interacting in a cyclic manner - A consumes B, B consumes C and C consumes A. In contrast to the closely related Rock-Paper-Scissors model, the May-Leonhard model does not incorporate reproduction in its predation reactions, but has independent reproduction processes for each species. The most striking feature of this model when run on a two-dimensional lattice is the emerging spiral structures. We will strive to reproduce these spirals here.  "

    "Next, we set up the world. This involves setting up the species (the predator A and the prey B) and the reactions (B can give birth, A can die and predate upon B). The following are the parameters of the simulation:\n",
    "* `size`: This is the size of the 2D lattice and is specified as a tuple of two integers (the width and the height) like so `(256, 256)`. It is a good idea to start small since larger lattices take more memory and more computational time to simulate.\n",
    "* `sigma`: This is the predation rate of all three species, i.e. the rate with which A consumes B, B consumes C and C consumes A. For simplicity, we only look at the symmetric version wherein the rates are the same for all three species.\n",
    "* `mu`: This is the reproduction rate of all three species.\n",
    "* `h`: This is the hop rate, which in typically is left at a value of `1` since this will only rescale time. It could be varied for each species separately, such that one species moves slower than the others. Again, for simplicity's sake, we only look at the symmetric case.\n",
    "* `rho`: This is the initial density of each of the three species. It specifies how many occupants of each species will be present on each lattice site on average.\n",
    "* `T`: Specifies the end time of the simulation, i.e. how many Monte Carlo steps will be performed.\n",
    "* `K`: This is the carrying capacity of the lattice sites. It determines how many particles a site can hold. We have this set to 1 here.\n",
    "\n",
    "One crucial difference to the previous examples is that we introduce a carrying capacity into the system, and that this carrying capacity is set to one. Internally this changes the microscopic rules, such that interaction occurs across neighboring lattice sites rather than on the same site, and particles swap positions instead of simply hopping from lattice site to lattice site.
