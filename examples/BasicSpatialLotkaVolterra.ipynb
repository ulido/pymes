    "Next, we set up the world. This involves setting up the species (the predator A and the prey B) and the reactions (B can give birth, A can die and predate upon B). The following are the parameters of the simulation:\n",
    "* `size`: This is the size of the 2D lattice and is specified as a tuple of two integers (the width and the height) like so `(256, 256)`. It is a good idea to start small since larger lattices take more memory and more computational time to simulate.\n",
    "* `sigma`: This is the prey (species \"B\") birth rate. It regulates how quickly prey will reproduce.\n",
    "* `mu`: This is the predator (species \"A\") death rate. It regulates how quickly predators are removed from the system.\n",
    "* `lam`: This is the predation rate. It regulates how efficiently predators (species \"A\") consume prey (species \"B\") and reproduce at the same time.\n",
    "* `hA` and `hB`: This is the hop rate, which in typically is left at a value of `1` since this will only rescale time. It could be varied for each species separately, such that prey e.g. more static than predators or vice-versa.\n",
    "* `rhoA` and `rhoB`: This is the initial density of the predators (species \"A\") and prey (species \"B\"). It specifies how many occupants of each species will be present on each lattice site on average.\n",
    "* `T`: Specifies the end time of the simulation, i.e. how many Monte Carlo steps will be performed."

    "With the default parameters, what you should see if you scroll through the MC steps above is that initially the preys (`B`) are abundant while the predators (`A`) are sparsely distributed. The `B`s reproduce, however after 20 steps or so, the `A`s start to catch up, consuming `B`s and reproducing. This leads to an initial massive explosion of species `A`, and species `B` is driven almost to extinction. Species `A` runs out of `B` occupants to consume and itself rapidly drops in numbers. This allows `B` to recover, and the cycle repeats a few times. These are the famous Lotka-Volterra oscillations. However, in contrast to the popular mean-field equation model, these oscillations here are damped due to the spatially extended and stochastic nature of this system. After a few hundred steps, the system will have settled into a steady state where species numbers fluctuate around coexistence densities."
