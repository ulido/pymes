    "In this example, we examine activity fronts in the Lotka-Volterra system on a lattice. Activity fronts are waves of predator particles invading into a region filled with prey that was previously predator-free. The likely reason for the previous absence of predators is that an activity front has \"ravaged\" this region before and only now prey have come back here in sufficient numbers to support another wave of predators."

    "Next, we set up the world. This is very similar to the basic example. It again involves setting up the species (the predator A and the prey B) and the reactions (B can give birth, A can die and predate upon B). The main differences are that we make the world bigger to study activity fronts, and that we fill the lattice with prey particles that can neither reproduce nor move. This is an intentional oversimplification. We leave it as an exercise to make it more realistic. The following are the parameters of the simulation:\n",
    "* `size`: This is the size of the 2D lattice and is specified as a tuple of two integers (the width and the height) like so `(500, 500)`. This value is a good size to study activity fronts, but it also means that single runs can take a while to complete.\n",
    "* `sigma`: This is the prey (species \"B\") birth rate. It regulates how quickly prey will reproduce. We set this to zero here, since we don't want prey to reproduce for now (but there is no reason to not turn on reproduction later).\n",
    "* `mu`: This is the predator (species \"A\") death rate. It regulates how quickly predators are removed from the system.\n",
    "* `lam`: This is the predation rate. It regulates how efficiently predators (species \"A\") consume prey (species \"B\") and reproduce at the same time. We will vary this below to see how it affects the speed of activity fronts.\n",
    "* `hA` and `hB`: These are the hop rates of the species. We let the predators move freely, but will keep the prey stationary. Again, we leave it as an exercise to turn on prey movement and see how that affects activity fronts.\n",
    "* `nA` and `nB`: We set up the system such that every lattice site is filled with `nB=5` prey particles. We then seed the center of the lattice with `nA=10` predators.\n",
    "* `T`: Specifies the end time of the simulation, i.e. how many Monte Carlo steps will be performed."

As you move the slider to the right, you see an activity front develop and spread outward. The graph on the right again shows the total density of predators and prey over time. With the default settings, the prey do not reproduce, hence as they are consumed, they density of prey diminishes. As the predators move outwards, they consume prey and reproduce forming a circular front. The density of predators increases therefore in a quadratic manner as the front expands. This continues until the front merges with itself via the periodic boundary of the lattice and the front distorts and eventually vanishes."
